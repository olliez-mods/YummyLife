Docker scripts provided by YummyLife:
These are not required, but they do make it easy to build in a reliable enviroment.
WSL, and other methods do still work, docker scripts are an optional tool.

Note: You do need to have docker already installed on your system for this to run.
Note2: You only need to run the setup script once to download SDL
Note3: Scripts in this folder expect to be run from a subdirectory of YummyLife
       (in this case 'yummyLifeBuildScripts/<you-are-here>')

How to use:
1. Run setup script (This may take some minutes): "docker-compose run --rm setup"
2. Run build script:    -    -    -    -    -     "docker-compose run --rm build"
3. Done: The built exacuteables for Linux and Windows will be in '../devbuild/'

Building for a specific OS:
If you only want to build for Windows or Linux you can specify:
- "docker-compose run --rm build_linux"
- "docker-compose run --rm build_windows"

What are these commands I'm running?:
'docker-compose run' Let's us specify a build pattern to use (defined in 'docker-compose.yml').
adding '--rm' tells docker to remove the container onces it finishes (to reduce clutter and space).
next comes the pattern to use: 'setup', 'build', 'build_windows', 'build_linux', 'shell'.
'setup': Downloads and extracts extra libraries (SDL and libcurl) needed to build
'build/_linux/_windows': Goes through through the actual build proccess.
'shell': Puts you in an interactive shell inside the docker container

Failed build? - 4 steps to success!:
#1 Make sure Docker (or WSL2 Backend) has enough ram, set it to 8-10GB limit if possible
#2 If you are building for windows, sometimes it will fail the first time, try again
#2 Google the issue, docker is a widely used tool, someone might have the answer for you
#3 Make sure you are in the correct folder, you need to be in 'yummyLifeBuildScripts'
#3 Ping OliverZ in OHOL discord server (he is an idiot) with your problem
#4 Give up and use old hard methods
